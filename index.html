                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>Angels in Sports (AIS) is a Washington-based non-profit charity organization that provides scholarships for deserving underprivileged student athletes. Their scholarships finance academic support, advanced sports training opportunities, and/or advanced team play for the students they sponsor.</p>
                <p>The current Angels in Sports website is difficult to navigate, including several broken links and other functionality issues. It also lacks a cohesive design; the color palette in particular is eclectic and jarring for users when they move between the site's different pages.</p>    
                <p>The goal of this project was to redesign the Angels in Sports website to make it more functional, usable, and visually appealing, so that users who visit the website have a positive experience. We used both UX and UI research methods to determine how to proceed with this project.</p>

            <h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>I worked with my team to collaborate effectively through all of the stages of this project. In the empathizing phase, I contributed to the creation of a proto-persona and helped create a user research plan. In the user research part of the project I conducted user interviews and helped synthesize all of our interview data into an affinity diagram. In the definition and ideation phases I helped create a user testing plan and conducted user tests on the current Angels in Sports website to learn what users felt needed to be improved. I was heavily involved in the design elements of this project. I created a mood board, a style tile, and a style guide to guide the visual design of the wireframes my team members built. I also conducted user tests on our prototypes and compiled all of our research into a presentation to showcase our work on this project.

              <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>The first step in this project was to create a Proto-Persona based on our assumptions about how a parent who would use the Angels in Sports website might think and act.</p>
                <p>The proto-persona we created, Rachel, is a single parent who wants her children to be able to pursue their athletic goals, but she doesn't have the money she needs to pay for all of their athletics.</p>
                <p>She's also concerned about her children finding a good student/athlete balance.</p>
                <p>We used Rachel as a guide to help us come up with interview questions for our research plan. To learn more about users of the Angels in Sports website, we conducted interviews of six individuals who might need services like those provided by Angels in Sports and asked questions like the examples below. We asked users “why?” to get to the deeper answers, but the questions in our research plan served as jumping off points to get the conversation going.</p>

                    <p>We sorted the information gathered from User Interviews into an Affinity Diagram, allowing us to pinpoint several distinct pain points for our users, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Resources can be unreliable</p></li>
                        <li><p>Athletic programs are not well advertised</p></li>    
                        <li><p>Tutoring is expensive</p></li>
                        <li><p>Finding resources for specific sports can be difficult</p></li>
                        <li><p>Athletic Gear can be very Expensive</p></li>
                        <li><p>Traveling for Competitive League Games can cause academic struggles</p></li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>The current Angels in Sports website claims to resolve all of these pain points, but, as you will see when we get to user testing in a few slides, their website makes it very difficult for users to access their services.</p>

                    <p> Our next step was to create a User Persona based on our research. So, what changed from our Proto-Persona? In our Proto-Persona, one need Rachel had was for athletics to be an outlet for her children. When we interviewed our users, this wasn't something that was confirmed, so it was removed from our User Persona.</p>
                    <p>A pain point that came up during user interviews was the difficulties users faced finding information about community sports. This was something we added to our User Persona.</p>

                    <p>Next was determining the path Rachel takes to accomplish her goals using the Angels In Sports Website. From user research, we determined that our users would need to:</p>
                    <p>1. Find Information about the NPO</p>
                    <p>2. Access the scholarship application page, and</p>
                    <p>3. Be able to make donations</p>
                    <p>The user path helped us determine the tasks we asked users to perform while testing the current AIS website.</p>
                    <p>Using our User Path, we created a User Testing Plan with three tasks for users to test the current AIS design:</p>

                    <p>From our user testing results, we sorted the feedback we received from users into a 2x2 matrix and came to the following key takeaways to implement into the new Angels in Sports design:</p><br>    
                    <ul>
                        <p>1. Users want to be able to click on the AIS Logo and navigate to the Home Page.</p>
                        <p>2. Users were frustrated that the current Scholarship Page is not functional.</p>
                        <p>3. Users felt that the current AIS website has cosmetic issues such as colors and layout.</p>
                        <p>4. Users didn't like that there isn't an easy way to donate online.</p>
                        <p>5. Users disliked that the navigation bar was inconsistent—some tabs linked to pages and others did not.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From our user testing, we determined that users were able to navigate to the about page and find more information easily! Going forward, we decided to focus our design into improving the functionality within the Scholarships and the Donations paths.</p>
                    <p>To further determine our next course of action, we conducted a heuristics evaluation of the full site and the current navigation to discover what isn't working with the current design. Our key findings reflected several issues within the current design:</p>

                        <p><b>Consistency and Standards</b><br>The site has inconsistent color schemes, layouts, and graphics that make it difficult for the user to find continuity and consistency within the websites navigation.</p>
                        <p><b>Error Prevention</b><br>Some of the most important functions within the navigation and website are completely unusable and loop back to irrelevant pages, which makes the website nearly dysfunctional for users.</p>
                        <p><b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</b><br>Though the website somewhat preserves a design that is simplistic, there are a lot of elements in this websites current design that can be improved upon, such as color scheme and layout.</p>

                    <p>For the next phase we moved on to competitive analysis. This step provided insights into what three similar nonprofits to Angels in Sports are doing well with the UI of their websites.</p>
                    <p>Some of the insights we gained were: stay simple, create micro-interactions, utilize grids, make donations easy, use high-quality images, and implement a consistent color scheme and design throughout the website.</p>

                    <p>We asked three users to help us sort the contents of the Angels in Sports website into categories that felt natural to them. We combined the results of those card sorts, which ended up being very similar, into a new Sitemap. The new Sitemap is similar to the current Angels in Sports website, but it's based on the card sort our users did, there are two key changes:</p>
                    <p>1. The “Gallery” and “Videos” links were added to the “About” dropdown menu instead of being separate buttons on the homepage.</p>
                    <p>2. The “Home” tab was removed entirely, because in the redesign clicking on the AIS logo will take users to the home page.</p>

                    <p>The next step was to create a Style Tile for the new Angels in Sports website. The Style Tile expands on the early design ideas we started with when I created our Mood Board.</p>

                    <p>To begin wireframing our redesign, we created several mockups for low-fidelity wireframes for the websites visual design.</p>
                    <p>Design decisions were made to reflect our moodboard, along with the following user feedback:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Users felt the navigation design and functionality was inconsistent</p></li>
                        <li><p>Users desired improvement of the visual aesthetic</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Initial user feedback on the mobile design also helped identify that there was no donation page or scholarship application page. This feedback helped in the decision to make a design of those pages.</p>
                    <p>User feedback also impacted the creation of the the low-fidelity wireframes for mobile as we improved the location of the hamburger menu as well as improved the footer and overall page designs.</p>
                    <p>We conducted six five-second user tests on our low-fidelity wireframes (three on mobile and three on desktop) and made the following initial iterations before we moved on to mid-fidelity wireframes:</p>
                    <p><b>Desktop</b></p>
                        <ul><li>Make navigation titles hoverable</li></ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Mobile</b>
                        <ul><li>Move the hamburger menu to the right side</li>
                            <li>Implement more color</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Another step we needed to complete before moving on to mid-fidelity wireframing and prototyping was creating a UI style guide. I completed this task, expanding and iterating on the mood board and style tile I had already created.</p>

                    <p>Final user testing for our mobile and desktop prototypes were conducted with the three tasks in mind, two of which were from our original Usability Testing Plan:</p>
                        <p>1. Navigate to the donation page</p>
                        <p>2. Navigate to the scholarships page</p>
                        <p>3. Utilize the navigation menu</p>
                    <p>We sorted user feedback from testing into a 2x2 matrix. Two suggestions were implemented on desktop:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The scholarships button did not work. It is now fully functional.</li>
                        <li>The footer text was unreadable. We increased the font size from 9 to 12.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And another two on mobile: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure dropdown menu items work and had carrots to indicate dropdowns. We fixed the prototyping on those.</li>
                        <li>The button placement in the navigation felt off. We changed the button placement.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Full Completion: Although we accomplished a lot of the goals we set out to do, it would be great to implement a redesign for every page on the AIS website.</li>
                    <li>Make Contact with NPO: Although we did reach out to the AIS via email and tried to find a number to call, we were unsuccessful and it would have been great to get in contact to discuss and partner more with them.</li>
                    <li>More Time: Having more time would allow us to implement more micro interactions and other design elements that could personalize the website and keep improving where we ended with our design as there are still elements we can improve upon. Also more time would allow for making every button, link, etc. to be fully functional which would help the goal of reaching full completion.</li>
